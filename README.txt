REPORT: Rechannelling Hans

Recreated the Gapminder tool using the concepts that were taught during the lectures in the module and have included . We have covered all the functionalities required for the 
project to execute. The structure of our folders include index.html, main.js, style.css, data file (GCI_CompleteData4.csv) and files to import D3.js. Beginning with the index.html file, 
it includes a scatter plot which represents the Gapminder visualization and is aligned in the centre of the page followed by two bar graphs. The first bar graph represents the 12 pillars 
in the data starting from Institutions to Innovation and are aligned juxtaposing to each other just below the scatter plot.  The second bar graph represents the comparison between any two
countries for the 12 pillar values in the data.

The scatter plot consists of bubbles which are based on the Population size of the countries and are measured over two parameters, Gross Domestic Product on the X-axis and Global 
Competitiveness Index on the Y-axis. The bubbles in the plot represent countries which are segregated based on regions to which the colours are assigned accordingly. Additionally, the 
scatter plot has 7 buttons for the regions and if one wants to check the overtime growth of a region, one of the buttons could be clicked followed by the start button for visualization. 
The countries are individually separated and to check the growth of a particular country, one could select it by clicking on the circle of that country to view it. We have included a 
dropdown for yearly representations of the data, in which, a year could be selected to view the data in that particular year. It ranges from the year 2007 to 2017.  The data in the first 
bar chart which shows the 12 pillars for a particular country could either be viewed by clicking on the circle of a particular country at a particular year or by choosing the country and 
year values using the respective dropdowns for country and year.

In order to control the scatter plot, there are three buttons namely, ‘Start’ , ‘Stop’ and ‘Reset’. Click on ‘Start’, in order to play the animation of the scatter plot, click on ‘Stop’ 
to stop the animation and click on ‘Reset’ to reset the animation. In order to view a static scatter plot, enter the year in the textbox “Enter year between 2007 and 2017 to view scatter plot”.
Below the scatter plot, there are two bar graph visualisations. There are buttons representing different regions in the scatter plot. The first bar graph ‘Global Competitiveness Index for Individual Countries’ can be viewed by clicking on a circle (country)
in the scatter plot, which gives the details of the 12 pillars, for the particular year in the background of scatter plot at the time of the click. Alternate way of viewing first bar 
graph is by selecting the respective country and year values in the ‘Select First Country’ and ‘Select Year’ dropdown shown and by clicking the ‘Select’ button. The second bar graph 
‘Comparison between First country and Second Country for GCI’ can be viewed by selecting another country from ‘Select Country to Compare’ dropdown , pillar value from ‘Select Pillar’ 
dropdown and by clicking on ‘Compare’ button.
